# Introduction
Congratulations on reaching this milestone in your Django journey! This graded assessment is designed to test your skills and understanding of the Django framework. As you work through this assessment, remember that patience and perseverance are essential qualities for working with any back-end framework. Good luck!

# Goal
The goal of this assessment is to build two pages for a web app: the Menu page and the Menu Item page. These pages will contribute to creating a comprehensive website for a local neighborhood bistro called Little Lemon.

# Scenario
Little Lemon is a neighborhood bistro owned by Mario and Adrian. They understand the importance of having a digital presence to provide convenience and connection for their customers. As part of their efforts to enhance the customer experience, they have enlisted your help in building their website using the Django framework.

Throughout this course, you have been involved in various aspects of the website development, including creating views, dynamic templates, and building models and forms. Now, it's time to bring everything together and complete the most critical section of a food restaurant website: the Menu page.

# Learner Instructions
The Little Lemon website will consist of five pages: Home, About, Booking, Menu, and Menu Item. In this assessment, you will focus on creating the Menu page and the Menu Item page. These pages are essential for showcasing the bistro's menu items and providing detailed information about each item.

Please refer to the specific instructions provided in the project files to complete the implementation of these pages. Follow the Django best practices and utilize the knowledge and skills you have acquired throughout the course.

Good luck with the assessment, and remember to ask for help or clarification whenever needed. Enjoy the journey of bringing the Little Lemon website to life!
